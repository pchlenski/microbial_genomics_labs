To start this lab, we'll look a little more closely at Burrows-Wheeler Transforms (BWT).\n",

After all, the main problem that the BWT is used to solve in bioinformatics is searching for one block of text within a larger block. At the most basic level, we learned a few Bash commands that can search text- think of `grep`. Since sequence data is just text, can't we just use these tools to perform such searches? In theory, yes- but as with so many things in the world of bioinformatics, the problem is a balance between memory and time.\n",

        "So- searching a 20-length sequence across 11M reads took about 0.5 seconds. That might not seem bad; however, when you consider that this is in fact an rather small fastq file (it's not uncommon to have bacterial sequences on the order of 100x larger), that 0.5 seconds now becomes 50 seconds. That doesn't seem so bad either, but we typically aren't just querying sequences from one organism- we are querying databases with hundreds of millions of sequences. This adds up quickly- and this is a single, relatively simple query. If we begin thinking about alignment and queries involving multiple sequences, it should be clear that in order to perform bioinformatics at scale, we need a faster solution. Indexing could speed up our search problem- but at the expense of requiring *a lot* of storage space. A single human genome would require ~200GB to index; think about trying to do this for every possible species!"
