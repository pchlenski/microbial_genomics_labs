Unlike our `fasta` files, `fastq` files have no context on where they came from or what organism they belong to- it's up to us to figure this out via assembly. Fortunately, there are many excellent tools to help us!\n","\n","The anatomy of a `fastq` file differs from a `fasta` file in several key ways:\n","* Each DNA strand (i.e., forward and reverse) will often have a separate set of reads; these are usually contained in two separate files, but can sometimes be \"interleaved\" in a single file (in the case of paired-end sequencing)\n","* FastQ files are typically much larger than their FastA counterparts; this is because it takes many reads to create a single high-quality sequence\n","* Each read in a FastQ typically contains four lines; the first begins with an @ symbol and a sequence ID, followed by the sequence itself, a line with a + symbol, and finally, a line describing the quality of the read.
